The Http Post Tool is made to send repeatable test cases to mutliple environments of a SAP PI (Process Integration or associated ABAP Proxy Runtimes) landscape for testing purposes.

Often the same messages need to be posted through PI again and again, even on DEV and later TEST stages of a PI landscape.
Eventually even on PROD environments.
